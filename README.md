# Home Surveillance Quarantine System

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The Home Surveillance Quarantine System addresses the challenge of long queues outside clinics by providing a digital platform for individuals to assess their COVID-19 risk, monitor symptoms, and receive quarantine orders if necessary. This system captures personal information, vaccination status, and travel history. Users can also input daily health assessments, and if identified as a close contact, receive an order to quarantine. Additionally, the system enables users to input data for dependents who may not use smartphones. The collected data can be utilized by medical teams for diagnosis and by the government for tracking virus exposure.

### 1.2 Project Details

The database system manages entities such as Applicants, Individuals Entering Malaysia, Transportation, Daily Health Assessment, Test, Traveller, Applications, and Vaccination. It records information about users, their attributes, and tasks related to the system. The project aims to streamline processes related to COVID-19 monitoring, enhance data accessibility, and contribute to reducing the virus's spread.
